== Perl Dynaloader problems with Nix ==

When using a Nix Perl in a standard Debian build you get something like:

Can't load './example.so' for module example: libstdc++.so.6: cannot open
shared object file: No such file or directory at
/nix/store/83h6qqwz8wgah3xymzaklwvmhxhcli47-perl-5.10.0/lib/5.10.0/i686-linux/DynaLoader.pm
line 203.  at biolib/example.pm line 10

The problem is that the Nix Perl binaries do not 'know' about Debian libstdc++. This can be fixed by building BioLib in the Nix environment.
