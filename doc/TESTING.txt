= TESTING =

The BioLib and ASciLib projects use these cmake modules and come with
testing scripts. These can be run with:

  cmake .
  make
  make test

Before a release a 'release candidate tree' is tested using different
setups using a virtualized image of a base install of Debian and
Cygwin.

The ./scripts/fulltest script logs in to different local virtual
machines using ssh and clones the git repositories afresh. Next it
runs the tests and gathers the results for display.
